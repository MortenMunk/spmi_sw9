*Efficient computation during training*
- Causal LM inference is fast

*Best methods from comparative study*
- We don't have time for them all
- Some are more inference focused

*Summary*
- We care about efficiency during training
- Inference for long cipher struggle due to lack of generalization on long ciphers
