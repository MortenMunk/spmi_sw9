*Why not test on a real cipher?*
- E.g. Civil War Vigenere cipher
- Real ciphers has typos, etc.

*Cipher lengths*
- No real stress testing

*Missing other neural baselines*
- LSTM or Transformers

*Missing sections*
- Related work
- Future Work

#pause

*Current better models - (like CausalLM)*
- We know this because we are from the future #emoji.face.smile
