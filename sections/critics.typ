*Why not test on a real cipher?*
- The real Caesar cipher
- Civil War Vigenere cipher

*Sequence length bottleneck*
- 200 chars is short!
- Concat timing limited to training length
- GANs are likely to become unstable

*Why only compare against non-neural approaches?*
- Maybe compare with LSTM, etc?

#pause

*Current better models - (like CausalLM)*
- We know this because we are from the future #emoji.face.smile
