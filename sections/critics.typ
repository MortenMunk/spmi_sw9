*Why not test on a real cipher?*
- E.g. Civil War Vigenere cipher
- Real ciphers has typos, etc.

*Sequence length bottleneck*

- GANs are likely to become unstable

*Why only compare against non-neural approaches?*
- Other neural baselines?

#pause

*Current better models - (like CausalLM)*
- We know this because we are from the future #emoji.face.smile
